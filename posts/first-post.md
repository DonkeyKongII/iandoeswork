title: Catharsis, ruined run, and I'm a horse

So... this is the first post. I guess I should explain myself. Why does this even exist? This, being this blog. I can't answer that. I don't even know why it exists. I can tell you a little bit about what inspired it.

First things first. Initially, I saw this as a fun way to learn about static site generators. I happened upon 11ty. It had a cool name. I decided to check it out.

Second, I find writing to be cathartic. I'll use my blog as a cathartic release.

Third, I'm planning to get hardcore into running again. Assuming all goes well, I thought this would be a fun way to track my training and progress.

I can't say I need a cathartic release today. I'll leave that to another post. And believe me, it's a rare day without a need. There will be plenty in the future. Don't worry. 

That leaves running. Today is supposed to be my glorious return to running. It started out pretty good. I did a quick workout in the garage:

* 20 x left static lunges
* 20 x right static lunges
* 20 x squats
* 7 x way legs left side
* 7 x way legs right side
* 20 x situps
* 30 x second front blank
* 30 x second left blank
* 30 x second right plank
* 20 x left chest press
* 20 x right chest press
* 20 x chest press
* 20 x shoulder presses
* 20 x right shoulder press
* 20 x left shoulder press

<br /> 

That doesn't seem like too much. Unfortunately, it was pretty tiring. I guess that's what happens when you've been a couch potato for the last 5 months.

I also started a new diet today. I bought groceries and got a bunch of "healthy stuff." I made a salad today with asparagus, broccoli, kale, red bell pepper, and mushrooms. I used greek yogurt as the dressing. I'm a horse now. 

Lastly, for my glorious comeback run... it didn't happen. It was raining all day today, and I was unable to run. *Le sigh*
